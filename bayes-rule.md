# Bayes’ Rule

You learned about probabilities and Bayes' rule.![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/VHqsZL5ZQVq6rGS-WXFatw_ccc93fcfcf494902b0e84028f991ac0a_Screen-Shot-2020-09-08-at-1.11.11-PM.png?expiry=1602460800000&hmac=-31OwwYmMiZLiNyacyf7VkfnFt65W7o1F5wbJNbNOlM)

To calculate a probability of a certain event happening, you take the count of that specific event and you divide by the sum of all events. Furthermore, the sum of all probabilities has to equal 1.![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/9VhrmYOdSnmYa5mDnbp5VQ_e7b4d6b4a6fc4a5686deb502c9613b92_Screen-Shot-2020-09-08-at-1.16.17-PM.png?expiry=1602460800000&hmac=kV68zZwLq95rlXYq7_m4cFEIYnY0ZBGz3qN86G9jFbw)

To compute the probability of 2 events happening, like "happy" and "positive" in the picture above, you would be looking at the intersection, or overlap of events. In this case red and blue boxes overlap in 3 boxes. So the answer is \frac{3}{20}203​.
