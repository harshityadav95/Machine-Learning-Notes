### 5. Anomaly Detection <a id="41c4"></a>

We use anomaly detection for discovering abnormal activities and unusual cases like fraud detection.

### 6. Sequence Pattern Mining <a id="437e"></a>

We use sequential pattern mining for predicting the next data events between data examples in a sequence.

### 7. Dimensionality Reduction <a id="34e0"></a>

We use dimensionality reduction for reducing the size of data to extract only useful features from a dataset.

### 8. Recommendation Systems <a id="890c"></a>

We use recommenders algorithms to build recommendation engines.
