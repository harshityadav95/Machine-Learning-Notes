 There are several ANN algorithms such as

1. Spotify’s \[[ANNOY](https://github.com/spotify/annoy)\]
2. Google’s \[[ScaNN](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/scann)\]
3. Facebook’s \[[Faiss](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss)\]
4. And my personal favorite: Hierarchical Navigable Small World graphs \[[HNSW](https://github.com/nmslib/hnswlib)\]
